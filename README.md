# Progressive Feature Selection Network with Fault-Aware Deformable Convolution for Railway Fault Detection
# 1. Abstract
***
Reliable detection of railway track faults is essential for ensuring the safety and continuity of railway operations. Despite the remarkable progress achieved by deep learning approaches, CNN- and Vision Transformer (VT)-based models struggle to accurately identify defects from images with complex and irrelevant backgrounds due to the insufficient fusion of local fault characteristics and global contextual dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose PFDCNet, a dual-branch network that integrates ResNet-50 for capturing local details and an enhanced VT (EVT) branch for global context modeling. In the proposed EVT branch, the Feature Selection (FS) modules based on self-attention mechanism filters out irrelevant background noise and generate discriminative multi-scale features via unpatchify operations, enabling alignment with the ResNet-50 branch. To enhance defect localization, a cross-attention (CA) mechanism is introduced in the EVT branch to correlate the CLS token with ResNet-50 feature maps, allowing it to locate the key fault-related areas and compensate for the information loss caused by the feature selection. To unify multi-scale features from both branches, a Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (FFPN) is further proposed, which fuses aligned features and utilizes CA-derived fault regions to guide deformable convolutions through an offset loss, thereby enhancing focus on potential defect areas. Extensive experiments on real railway defect datasets demonstrate the outperformance of PFDCNet than several state-of-the-art, offering a promising solution for practical railway fault monitoring systems.
